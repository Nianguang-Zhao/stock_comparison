# ✅ 404 Issue Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

The `stock_comparison.html` and `stock_comparison.png` files were missing from the GitHub repository. I've now pushed them.

## ✅ Files Now in Repository

- ✅ `index.html` - Main page
- ✅ `stock_comparison.html` - Interactive chart
- ✅ `stock_comparison.png` - Static chart image
- ✅ All other necessary files

## 🔄 Next Steps

### 1. Wait for GitHub Pages to Deploy (1-2 minutes)

GitHub Pages needs to rebuild after the new files are pushed. Wait 1-2 minutes.

### 2. Check GitHub Pages Status

1. Go to: https://github.com/Nianguang-Zhao/stock_comparison/settings/pages
2. Look for a green checkmark ✅ or deployment status
3. You should see: "Your site is live at https://nianguang-zhao.github.io/stock_comparison/"

### 3. Visit Your Site

After 1-2 minutes, visit:
**https://nianguang-zhao.github.io/stock_comparison/**

### 4. If Still 404 After 2 Minutes

Try these steps:

1. **Force a rebuild**:
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Change the branch from `main` to something else, save
   - Change it back to `main`, save
   - This forces a rebuild

2. **Check Actions tab**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/Nianguang-Zhao/stock_comparison/actions
   - See if there are any deployment errors

3. **Verify files are in repository**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/Nianguang-Zhao/stock_comparison
   - You should see `index.html`, `stock_comparison.html`, and `stock_comparison.png` in the file list

## 📋 What's Now Working

- ✅ All files pushed to GitHub
- ✅ GitHub Pages should detect files automatically
- ✅ Site should be live in 1-2 minutes
- ✅ Daily auto-updates will work via GitHub Actions

## 🎯 Your Site URL
